# 🔥 New Feature: Random Command! 🔥

## What's New? 👀

The `random` command is finally here! I've been excited for this one 🎉 Let's check it out:

- **Random Results**: As the name implies, the `random` command will pull a random character name and image to make into a smash or pass poll. Characters are pulled from Danbooru regardless of a user's selected search engine.

## How It Works 🛠️

1. **Use the `/random` Command**: Choose the type of poll you'd like (`no prompt` or `weird prompt`) and let the bot do the rest.
2. **Bot Finds a Character**: The bot will search for a random Danbooru character tag and submit the poll.

This command has been cooking for a while, so please enjoy it to its fullest! It's even fun to do solo, so I hope smaller servers get a lot of use out of it as well. Speaking of which...

## Sneak Peek 👁️👄👁️

I've had so much using random by myself, that I think it's a shame users can't vote on their own polls. I know some folks have been asking for this for a while, so please expect this in the next big update!

Thank you all so much for playing, and keep smashing 😈
