# 🎉 V3 Update: Improved CustomSmash Command! 🎉

## What's New? 🤔

Are you tired of seeing poor Mei in the mud because your `customSmash` didn't return any results? Are you over consulting Danbooru's User Guide for proper formatting? If so, the latest updates to the `customSmash` command are for you! Here's what you can expect:

### 🔍 Intelligent Character Search

- **No More Formatting Worries**: When you use the `customSmash` command, the bot will now take its best guess at which character you're searching for, even if your input isn't perfectly formatted for Danbooru.
- **Top 10,000 Character Tags**: The bot will match your character name input with the top 10,000 character tags from Danbooru to find the best match for you.

### 🌟 Optional URL Input

- **Custom URL**: If the image you receive isn't what you expected, don't worry! You can always input your own URL to ensure the image is exactly what you want.

## How It Works 🛠️

1. **Use the `/customSmash` Command**: Simply type in the character name you're looking for and leave the URL field blank.
2. **Bot Matches the Name**: If you don't include a URL *and* the character name you entered doesn't match a Danbooru tag, the bot will search through Danbooru's top 10,000 characters to find a match.
3. **Optional URL**: If the match isn't perfect, you can provide a custom URL to get the exact image you want.

## Smooth Sailing ⛵

I hope this update makes playing Smash or Pass much easier and more fun! Just type what you want, and let the bot do the rest. And if you need to be specific, the custom URL option has got you covered 😎

Thank you for your continued support, and keep smashing 😈
