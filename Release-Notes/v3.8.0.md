# 😎 Latest Update: Vote on your own polls! 😎

## What's New? 👀

Who needs friends? Not you! Or at least you don't anymore to vote on `random` and `custom smash` polls 🎉

### ☝️ Single Player

**Vote on your own polls:** That's right - users may now vote on their own `random` and `custom smash` polls. After all, why _shouldn't_ you be able to announce you want to smash that picture of Vegeta _you_ posted?

## How It Works 🛠️

**Create a Poll:** Just like usual, start a poll using `/random` or `/custom_smash` and then vote however you want! Votes on your own polls will even generate smorps 🪙 as if someone else voted. Users still cannot vote on their own `smash` polls, and voting on your own poll will not generate a `love letter` survey!

## What's next?? 💡

Please let me know what other features you'd like to see! I'd love to hear from you all how I can keep making the bot even more fun for you 🎈


Thank you as always for your support, and keep smashing 😈
