# 🎉 Smash or Pass V3: Major Upgrade! 🎉

Hello, everyone! I'm super excited to share the shiny, new Smash or Pass V3 with you all ✨ 

This upgrade will be released tomorrow ☀️ but here's a sneak peek 👀

## Major Changes 🚀

* **Image Fetching:** The bot can now automatically fetch images from Danbooru and Google 🔥🔥🔥
* **New Prompts:** Added 30 new prompts for smash or pass polls 🤢 They're weird.
* **Survey Rework:** Totally reworked the survey questions presented after voting on a smash or pass poll. The surveys are now called love letters 💌 and can be claimed using the love_letter command.
* **Free Voting Buttons:** CRUSH, GUSH, and FLUSH buttons are now available to use freely. Flush those items down the toilet 🚽
* **Command Changes:** Removed the buy, delete_character, and shop commands. Added the search_engine command to allow choosing which search engine to use for custom_smash polls.
