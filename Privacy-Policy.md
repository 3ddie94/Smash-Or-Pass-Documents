# Privacy Policy
 
Last updated: March 20, 2022


 
The Smash or Pass bot (herein referred to as “the bot”) requires the collection of certain data from its users and the servers on which it operates in order to function properly. Data collected by the Smash or Pass bot includes, but is not limited to:



- The Discord server ID on which a user interacts with the bot and the Discord user ID and username (or nickname) of any users that use one of the bot’s slash commands or interact with any of the buttons it generates on messages it authored
- User input values needed to operate certain slash commands
- Information related to a user’s Patreon subscription tier needed to manage subscription benefits



The collected data is stored in a database deployed on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) public cloud. Every reasonable effort is made by the Proprietor of the bot to restrict access to user data in the database. User data will not be shared without consent. Users may remove their specific user data by request. Requests may be sent via email to smashorpassbot@gmail.com or by contacting a server administrator on the Smash or Pass community Discord server at https://discord.gg/SUyXYV9BN6. The Proprietor of the bot will make a reasonable effort to accommodate data removal requests in a timely manner.



This Privacy Policy is subject to frequent changes without prior notice. Reviewing the content of this document regularly is advised. Changes to the document will be reflected by the date shown in the “Last updated” section at the top of the policy.
