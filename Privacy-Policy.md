# Privacy Policy
 
Last updated: January 30, 2022


 
The Smash or Pass bot (herein referred to as “the bot”)  requires the collection of certain data from its users and the servers on which it operates in order to function properly.  Data collected by the Smash or Pass bot includes, but is not limited to:



- The Discord user ID of any users that use one of the bot’s slash commands or interact with any of the buttons it generates
- The Discord guild ID of any server on which the bot operates



The collected data is stored in an in-memory database on a virtual private server (VPS) operated by a third-party organization. Access to the VPS is restricted to the Proprietor of the bot - not including any mandatory access by the third-party organization responsible for the VPS’s operation. The collected data is not stored in a persistent database and is lost upon the bot process stopping - whether planned or unplanned. Stopping of the bot process is an irregular occurrence that is not guaranteed to follow any specific cadence.



This Privacy Policy is subject to frequent changes without prior notice. Reviewing the content of this document regularly is advised. Changes to the document will be reflected by the date shown in the “Last updated” section at the top of the policy.



Questions related to the Privacy Policy may be directed to the Proprietor:
